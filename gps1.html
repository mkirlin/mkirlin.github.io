            <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
            
            <p>Pair programming is the practice of having two programers working together on a single coding project. One partner works as the driver, actually writing the code. The other works as the navigator, telling the driver what to write. Sometimes the navigator tells the driver what specific code to write, while other times the navigator speaks in pseudo-code, or code-like language, that the driver can interpret. Both members of the pairing take turns acting in each role.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Pair Program?</h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Pair programming gives you another set of eyes on your code, giving a partner a chance to catch mistakes, and simplify code as it is written. This decreases the amount of time spent refactoring.</li>
              <li>Pairing with another programmer gives you a partner that keeps you accountable and on track while you code.</li>
              <li>Programming in pairs leads to programmers coming up with more ideas about how to design and write code due to having someone else available to brainstorm ideas with.</li>
              <li>Studies have shown that "paired programmers are 15% slower than two independent individual programmers, while 'error-free' code increased from 70% to 85%."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#Williams:_error_reduction_with_increased_effort"><sup>1</sup></a> A slight decrease in speed leads to an enormous increase in quality output.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How to Pair Program, Dev Bootcamp Style</h2>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Personal Check-In: at DBC we begin each pair programming session by checking-in with the other person. We want to know how their day has been, how they're feeling, and what they're bringing to the table today.</li>
              <li>Work-Approach Check-In: after the personal check-in, we do a work-approach check-in. How does each member of the pair like to work? Are they a "code it up and figure it out as we go" type of programmer, or a person who wants to plan in more detail before they start coding? Working this out beforehand can make life easier for everyone later on.</li>
              <li>Discuss Jobs: next, we discuss who's going to take which job. Some people prefer starting with one or the other. Remember, both people will eventually do both jobs, so it's not incredibly important who starts with which job.</li>
              <li>Code: write some code! The driver actually types the code up, while the navigator tells them what they are writing.</li>
              <li>Trade Jobs: about halfway through the session, or at some point where there's a natural break, the pair should change jobs. The driver starts to navigate and the navigator starts to drive.</li>
              <li>Code: after the switch, keep writing code. A pairing session usually lasts about an hour, giving both partners a fair amount of time to take both roles..</li>
              <li>Quick Feedback: finally, when you're done with the programming session, give each other quick feedback about your feelings about the session and their pairing style. Remember to use the ASK model of giving feedback: make sure your feedback is Actionable (something they can change), Specific (one or two narrow things they can work on) and Kind (not pointlessly mean or critical).</li>
