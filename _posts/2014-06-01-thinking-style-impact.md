I'm mostly Abstract Sequential. Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random are roughly tied well behind that, and then Abstract Random distantly trails everything.

Abstract sequential thinkers analyze and react. They tend to do best when they can see the big picture. They’re typically precise and logical, and they use facts to make their case. They like to read to get information. They tend to be rules-followers. They don’t like being rushed, working with incomplete information, unclear or incomplete instructions, having to express their emotions, or working with people who aren’t as logical or talented as they are.

My biggest struggle is just getting everything done. I am a procrastinator and it has hurt me throughout my life. I’m trying to build a system that will let me get work done more efficiently without being distracted as often, but it is difficult. It isn’t really related to my thinking style, except in the abstract; my style of thinking and working lets me elaborately distract myself. My current strategies include:

<ul>
    <li>the use of HabitRPG to organize my days and tasks</li>
    <li>writing things by hand when possible, rather than always being on the computer</li>
    <li>using a system similar to the Pomodoro technique to get work done</li>
    <li>work schedules and pre-programmed distraction breaks</li>
</ul>

I think the main thing that will help me expand and grow my learning style is to focus on the things that both my learning style predicts and that I know from experience that I am not good at. I struggle with having to do work without prep time, making sure every little piece of work is perfect, not competing excessively, and not monopolizing interactions. These are all things that AS thinkers are identified as struggling with. I’m going to keep working on these tendencies, pushing in the direction that my brain isn’t naturally pointed towards. I think that doing so will broaden my abilities and my competencies.

Update (September 25, 2014):

Well, HabitRPG fell by the wayside, as did the Pomodoro technique. For the most part, my style remained the same: I yelled at myself until I did things. It helped that I was actually excited to be at DBC and I really wanted to be doing what I was doing. I don't advocate starting new time management techniques when you start DBC.
