Like pretty much everyone else, as soon as DBC started, I stopped blogging. There are a few superhumans out there who managed to keep writing during that timeframe (for example, my genius compatriot [Duke Green](https://dukegreene.wordpress.com/)), but it came down to doing the work or writing blogs. I think I made the right decision. Sorry, grouchy future boots who stumble on this page. However, now that I'm done, I'm going to start writing on a regular basis. I've got free time, and I'm going to need to start getting thoughts down on paper. I figured I would start with the eternal classic, "I just finished a thing, so here's the next thing I'm doing."
<br>
<br>
Since DBC is over, I need some projects to work on. My plan right now is to split my time between original projects, open source work, and learning/tutorials. This week, I started working on a microdonation platform with a few non-DBC friends. Sometime this weekend, I'm going to get an Egghead membership and start the Node.js tutorial. I'm looking around for open source projects that are interesting right now. I haven't found anything that really grabs me, but I'm going to keep looking. I'm also going to build a Rails app every couple of weeks. I know that I need to build muscle memory in everything right now, and I want to make sure I don't lose anything I spent so much time and effort learning.
<br>
<br>
Of course, since DBC is over, I also need to find a job. So that's eating up the time that I'm not spending coding. Job hunting is obviously always stressful, but in a way, it's nice to have two clearly delineated tasks. When I'm sick of coding, or I hit a wall, I can swap over to job hunting. When the creeping strangeness of cold outreach starts to strangle the heart within my chest, I can go back to doing something fun and interesting. Maybe it's not so nice.
<br>
<br>
So that's the post-DBC grind in a nutshell: still writing a lot of code, still learning a lot about coding, but now there's exciting job-hunting activities mixed in with the coding. For a given value of exciting. It's still hard to believe that DBC is over, but I'm finding myself incredibly excited for the future for the first time in a long time, and that's a nice feeling.
