Who I Am:
---------

Hi! My name is Michael Kirlin, and I'm a web developer. I graduated from Dev Bootcamp in September of 2014. I currently live in Chicago and am looking for junior developer opportunities.
<br>
<br>

My Background:
---------

I'm originally from West Des Moines, IA, where my parents and younger brother still live. Before Dev Bootcamp, I graduated from Creighton University in Omaha, NE, with a dual B.A. in International Relations and Spanish and an M.A. in Education. Immediately before I went to Dev Bootcamp, I student-taught a third grade class and worked as a substitute teacher in Omaha. I found that while I loved working with the students, I disliked the excessive bureaucracy of the modern educational system. I had always wanted to learn to code, but I had a hard time staying focused. Over the years before I came to DBC, I had tried several online coding courses and never completed any of them. Finding DBC was like flipping a switch. I quickly realized that after years of looking for what I wanted to do, I had finally found it in software development.

My Hobbies (y'know, other than coding):
---------

* Reading (I'm a news fiend in particular, but I read everything)
* Writing (short fiction, never to be published)
* Weightlifting (and very occasionally running)
* Tabletop gaming (RPGs, Munchkin, Forbidden Island)
* Kickstarter (to an unhealthy degree)
* Watching college football (Go Irish!)
* Adding unecessary and excessive parentheticals to things
