                <article>

                    <p>Well, it used to be just fighter/cleric/magic user, but it’s gotten more complex since then - oh in Ruby. Right, right, that would make more sense.</p>

                    <p>The easiest way to describe a class is to say that it is a prototype, or a framework. A class is a tool used to create objects. The objects that a class creates will have certain characteristics, based on the framework of the class. Classes are useful when you know you have a lot of data to keep track of that’s kinda-almost-sorta identical, but that has a lot of small differences, all of which you will also have to keep track of. It’s sort of a tool for when you know something’s going to be obnoxious. The nice thing is, though, that classes exist to make that obnoxious sort of nitpicky record-keeping easier. You use classes because the other ways to keep track of that much nearly-identical data are far, far more difficult to use.</p>

                    <p>But how do I use classes? That’s an excellent question, imaginary interlocutor. Let’s make up an example! Maybe you would like to build a program that tracks students at the school you work at. You might decide to do that by creating a class that can produce a unique object for each student that will contain their data. You would start by defining your class. (It would probably be smart to call it something sort of obvious, like, say, Student.)</p>

                    <img src="./unit1_projects/images/define_class.png"/>

                    <p>Then, right after you define it, you put in the initialize method. Initialize is what kicks off the whole show. Most classes need to have an initialize method. Initialize is going to take some number of arguments for the data that your students are going to have in common (that kinda-almost-sorta identical data). You know that students are going to have some data that is relatively similar. Generally speaking, students have names and ages. They have someone or someones who are acting as guardians for them. They are in a certain grade. The list goes on. Were we building this for an actual school system, there would probably be a far larger list of potential arguments for all sorts of other information: medical history, living situation, lunch payments, on and on, unto eternity. School bureaucracy is the best bureaucracy. Anyway, we’ll start by giving our initialize method just a few different arguments:</p>

                    <img src="./unit1_projects/images/init_class.png"/>

                    <p>Once we give it those arguments, we need to let them be accessed throughout the rest of the object that will be created. We do this by converting them from local variables (what they are now, a type of variable that can only be accessed within this particular method) into instance variables (variables that can be accessed by any method in the objects that this class will eventually create. This is done in a super complex and highly technical way. Observe:</p>

                    <img src="./unit1_projects/images/instance_variables.png"/>

                    <p>I know. It blew my mind the first time too. Once we’ve done that, since we don’t have any other changes we want to make to the data that will be added when the class is called upon to create a new object, we just end the initialize method and ta-da: we have ourselves a class. At the moment, it can’t do much, but that’s ok. We just need to add some methods!</p>

                    <p>Methods that are built into classes are called instance methods. Instance methods are methods that can be called on the objects the class creates. Let’s build a quick one to demonstrate what this means. We’re going to build a method that, when called, tells us what grade any given student is in. We start by defining a method in much the same way we defined initialize. However, to keep this simple, we’re not going to require any parameters.</p>

                    <p>Our new method, tell_grade, is very simple. All it’s going to do is tell us what grade our student is in. To do this, it’s going to have to access a few of the instance variables we created above.</p>

                    <img src="./unit1_projects/images/instance_method.png"/>

                    <p>Pretty straightforward. Let’s give it a quick test run. We’ll create a new student using the Student class. We will give that new student a name, age, grade, and two guardians’ names, </p>

                    <img src="./unit1_projects/images/new_object.png"/>

                    <p>and then we’ll see if we can query the object to find out what grade our student is in. We hop over to Terminal, run our program, and we get this outcome:</p>

                    <img src="./unit1_projects/images/terminal_results.png"/>

                    <p>Exactly what we were looking for.</p>

                    <p>Now, obviously, this has been a very simplistic overview of classes. But the important thing to take away is that classes impart all sorts of functionality and give us an incredibly useful tool for modeling real-world items in our code.</p>

                    <p>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</p>

                    <p>It's been kind of challenging. Parts of it have been a lot of fun; I had a session last week that was really rewarding, and at the end of it I really felt like I had learned a lot. However, there have also been pairings where I've felt superflouous, pairings where I've felt frustrated because I've outstripped the other person, and pairings where we just didn't click. Overall, I think I'm liking it slightly more than I'm disliking it, but it is definitely raising conflicting feelings in me.</p>

                    <p>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</p>

                    <p>The pair chellange last week - challenge 6, debugging the North Korean missile code - was a ton of fun. At the end of it, I felt like I had a really firm grasp of a lot of the subjects we were working on and I had a great time working with my pair.</p>

                    <p>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</p>

                    <p>I have had two pairing sessions where I felt like we weren't really on the same page, and the pairing suffered from that. I also think there's a side of my personality that has very little patience or sympathy for people who don't get things quickly, and I have had a pairing session or two where I was short with my partner because I was feeling somewhat contemptuous of the other person. That's a problem with my attitude, though.</p>

                    <p>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</p>

                    <p>Mostly pretty good, with a side helping of unhappiness. There were a few pieces of feedback that were positive with qualifications, and I tend to read that as criticism. But I also recognize that I have a tendency towards being overbearing - it's a familial trait - and that came through in some of the feedback.</p>

                    <p>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</p>

                    <p>It was. I know some of the things I need to work on; I've spent a long time reprogramming my own social interactions, but I know I have a lot of ground left to cover. It's always good to get feedback on those things. I feel like you'll never improve if you don't get good feedback, and I need that interaction.</p>

                    <p>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</p>

                    <p>I am constantly trying to relinquish the lead, and not be too "RAH RAH LEADERSHIP." That's the hardest thing for me, and I'm going to keep working on not dominating interactions.</p>

                    <p>How was it to write feedback?</p>

                    <p>Surprisingly difficult. I tried to keep ASK in mind when I was writing feedback and it was difficult. Being anything other than critical was difficult. I am conditioned to give feedback in a different way, and it has proved difficult to give good feedback in DBC.</p>

                    <p>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</p>

                    <p>It has been different aspects of it. Sometimes, I don't have anything I can think of that's actionable, other times it's tough to be specific. Sometimes you just want to say "Be better!", but that really isn't an option, and I know that, but the lizard brain doesn't really know that.</p>

                <article>

                    <h2>Privacy in Technology</h2>

                    <p>The biggest problem that is currently facing the tech industry is that people have lost confidence in the ability or willingness of tech companies to protect their privacy.</p> 

                    <h2>Background</h2>

                    <p>A series of revelations over the course of the last year that began with Edward Snowden’s leaking of confidential NSA documents have shown that the government has routinely spied on American citizens and they have done so with the cooperation of the major technology companies. In some cases, the relationships between the ever-expanding surveillance state and the massive players in Silicon Valley goes back almost two decades. In some cases, companies like Microsoft “collaborated closely with U.S. intelligence services to allow users’ communications to be intercepted, including helping the National Security Agency to circumvent the company’s own encryption.” Essentially, a number of major technology companies gave the government a massive backdoor into their products and user bases, right at a time when those user bases were growing massively and more and more people were sharing more and more information. Suddenly the government had its hands on a tremendous trove of information and, concerningly, there was no oversight into what this information was being used for.</p>

                    <p>Now, it would be an overstatement to say that this was a complete surprise. People who were paying close attention to the growth of the surveillance state over the last several years had some understanding that something like this was probably going on, but the Snowden release acted to confirm every single nightmare that many people had about the interactions between the major firms in Silicon Valley and the U.S. government. The government had been engaged in a massive effort to spy on the United States citizenry and the luminaries of Silicon Valley had happily aided in this effort.</p>

                    <h2>Why is this a problem?</h2>

                    <p>This question is a legitimate one to ask. After all, despite the massively illegal nature of the government’s actions in the last decade as revealed by Edward Snowden, most Americans think that some degree of surveillance is a necessity. Some large percentage of Americans have accepted the default, necessary, but tragic view that it is inevitable that the government is going to spy on its people. However, the technology industry does not need to be the facilitators of this spying, and I believe that, by allowing the government to so thoroughly enmesh the surveillance state into the technology industry, the industry is risking that it will come to be seen as fruit of the poisoned tree, so to speak. If technology cannot be trusted, then there is no point in buying it. On some level, people are willing to buy things as long as there are some protections involved; they will store their data on the cloud if they don’t think it will be stolen, or they will allow their communications to be transmitted if they don’t think that every message will be intercepted by the government. If the tech industry loses that trust, it will be gone for good, and I suspect that much of the current boom in prosperity will go with it.</p>

                    <h2>How can this problem be solved?</h2>

                    <p>Well, the cynical, but unfortunately probably accurate view is that it can’t be solved. The US government is a massively powerful entity and it can make life very, very difficult for companies that don’t work with it. If even companies like Google and Apple can be cowed by the government, then any company probably can be. If more companies were to follow the lead of LavaBit, an email provider used by Edward Snowden who destroyed his archives rather than give the government access to them, there might be some hope for solving this problem, but the evidence as it stands suggests that none of the major tech players are or ever were willing to actually fight for their users’ privacy. Increasingly it seems that the only real solution will be for companies to attempt to spin the erosion of privacy and for users to dial down there expectations for what level of privacy they will enjoy on the internet. </p>

                    <h3>7 June 2014</h3>
                </header>
            
                <article>

                    <h2>What are they?</h2>

                    <p>Both arrays and hashes are ways of storing data in Ruby. They both use an index structure to record information. However, they do this in distinctly different ways.</p>

                    <p>An array is a straightforward list of objects. It is denoted with square brackets. Each object in the array is indexed to a number, beginning with the number 0. So the first object in an array is object 0, the second is object 1, the third is object 2, the fourth is object 3, and so on throughout the array. These objects can be accessed by their index number. This is done by using the command array_name[#], where # is the index number. Objects in an array can also be accessed in reverse order with negative numbers, so -1 would be the last object, -2 would be the second to last object, and et cetera. Arrays can grow indefinitely, but they get more and more unwieldy the longer they grow; any search has to remember the precise position of whatever element you wish to access.</p>

                    <img src="./unit1_projects/images/sample_array.png" />

                    <p>A hash is slightly more complex. Hashes are also known as associative arrays. They consist of a list of what are called key-value pairs. The key is how these items are accessed. In that sense, it is equivalent to the index number in an array. However, in a hash, the key and the value can both be set to whatever you want it to be. You get to choose what key you associate with the value (thus the “associative array” sobriquet - geeks are incredibly imaginative). This can make it easier to remember - for example, if you were indexing a class of students, the keys could be their names, and the values could be the grades they receive.</p>

                    <img src="./unit1_projects/images/sample_hash.png" />

                    <p>Hashes give you more options for how you want to index an array. Also, they are usually faster to search through than an array would be. This is because they feature a tree structure of smaller arrays. Any search can look for the smaller arrays, rather than simply a long list of items as you would have in an array. Hashes also have some downsides; since you have to enter the keys, there is the chance that an error will be made when a key is being entered, making it difficult to access the value. Generally though, hashes are a more flexible tool for storing data.</p>

                    <h2>What are they good for?</h2>

                    <p>Arrays are good for storing shorter sets of information, or data sets where you only have to remember a single string or integer for each data point. Hashes are good for almost everything else, as they give you far more flexibility in building a storage solution that can match the specific custom keys you need with a multitude of values.</p>

                    <h2>How do you know which one to use?</h2>

                    <p>I’m going to try to avoid coming off like a programming super genius handing down knowledge from on high, as the truth is that I’m still not entirely sure when to use each type of data storage system. Generally, I think that an array would be useful when you have a single piece of data or just a few pieces of data and you want the flexibility of array methods, whereas a hash in useful in pretty mush any other situation because of that increased flexibility described above. That said, I have noticed that I tend to default to arrays in my own coding because they are simple to build and for our current needs, they do the job well. For almost any reasonably small data set, arrays work well, but hashes seem like a far better option for any larger or more unwieldy datasets you may encounter.</p>

                </header>
            
                <article>

                    <p>I'm mostly Abstract Seqeuntial. Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random are roughly tied well behind that, and then Abstract Random distantly trails everything.</p>
                    <p>Abstract sequential thinkers analyze and react. They tend to do best when they can see the big picture. They’re typically precise and logical, and they use facts to make their case. They like to read to get information. They tend to be rules-followers. They don’t like being rushed, working with incomplete information, unclear or incomplete instructions, having to express their emotions, or working with people who aren’t as logical or talented as they are.</p>
                    <p>My biggest struggle is just getting everything done. I am a procrastinator and it has hurt me throughout my life. I’m trying to build a system that will let me get work done more efficiently without being distracted as often, but it is difficult. It isn’t really related to my thinking style, except in the abstract; my style of thinking and working lets me elaborately distract myself. My current strategies include:

                        <ul>
                            <li>the use of Habit RPG to organize my days and tasks</li>
                            <li>writing things by hand when possible, rather than always being on the computer</li>
                            <li>using a system similar to the Pomodoro technique to get work done</li>
                            <li>work schedules and pre-programmed distraction breaks</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>I think the main thing that will help me expand and grow my learning style is to focus on the things that both my learning style predicts and that I know from experience that I am not good at. I struggle with having to do work without prep time, making sure every little piece of work is perfect, not competing excessively, and not monopolizing interactions. These are all things that AS thinkers are identified as struggling with. I’m going to keep working on these tendencies, pushing in the direction that my brain isn’t naturally pointed towards. I think that doing so will broaden my abilities and my competencies.</p>

                    <h3>1 June 2014</h3>
                </header>
            
                <article>

                    <h2>Why is it popular?</h2>
                    <p>The primary reasons JavaScript is popular is because it’s easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to customize for whatever uses you need. It is increasingly built into the backbone of the web, making it a necessary tool for dynamic websites. Also, the community has to some degree become self-perpetuating: the popularity of JavaScript means there are more resources available, and more people who can help solve problems with it, and more smart people making more add-ons and extensions.</p>
                    <h2>What are the great things about it?</h2>
                    <p>It’s easy to edit; all you need is a simple text editor and you can write JavaScript. You can learn it quickly and easily. Lots and lots of smart people have built things for it, so it has a lot of good libraries like jQuery that make it easy to use. It utilizes AJAX, which lets it reload parts of the page without having to reload the entire page. It loads quickly, and it loads on the client side, reducing server load. Basically, it’s a highly flexible, highly useful, tool with lots of applications.</p>
                    <h2>What are its limitations?</h2>
                    <p>The primary limitation with JavaScript is that it has some security holes that can be exploited by people with some knowledge and bad intent. Also, different browsers can interpret it differently, which can make it difficult to consistently display objects. Finally, due to lingering fears about those security issues, some users disable JavaScript, meaning that some subset of users might be completely incapable of using sites that use JavaScript.</p>

                    <h2>The Basics</h2>

                        <p>Every single element on a web page is a block. A standard, default web page is organized as one huge block within which you can create smaller blocks that will be stacked, one on top of the other.</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/website_block_model.png" /> <!--website block model-->

                        <p>However, you can tell these blocks to shrink and move around the page. The simplest way to do this is to give a couple of blocks the display:inline property. The code to do this looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--display:inline code-->

                        <p>and it creates this effect on the page:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--inline blocks-->

                        <p>So that’s ok. We can do a block, or we can do a bunch of blocks, all in a line like words wrapping down in a text box. These standard blocks have the inherent code position:static, which simply means they have the position they normally get from the page. But that doesn’t give us the cool effects and designs that we routinely see on the web. To get those, we have to make some other changes to our code.</p>

                    <h2>The Types of Positioning</h2>

                        <h4>Position: Relative</h4>

                        <p>Relative is a somewhat confusing positioning. When you just read the code, it seems like it is relative to some other element in the page. This, however, is incorrect. An item that has position:relative is in fact relative to <em>itself</em>. This means that the page figures out where that item would normally be if it had position:static, then moves it in whatever direction and distance your instructions tell it to move from that initial spot.</p>

                        <p>So say we had this piece of code:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--HTML and CSS creating a few blocks in a page-->

                        <p>It would create a web site that looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--results of above code-->

                        <p>But let’s say we go into that CSS and add this code to it:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/RPC.png" /> <!--CSS with relative positioning added-->

                        <p>Suddenly, our website looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/EORP.png" /> <!--website with shifted block-->

                        <p>The blocks that we had have moved right and down 200 pixels, relative from where it started. That’s really all there is to relative positioning.</p>

                        <h4>Position: Absolute</h4>

                        <p>Our next piece of code, position: absolute, is a little easier to wrap our minds around. This piece of code puts our block, or whatever element it is applied to, and sticks it to one exact position on the page. You give it the coordinates, and your block goes to that exact spot and stays there. This is powerful, but it has the potential to mess up how your website looks. An item with position:absolute is taken out of the flow of the page, so other items can potentially get stuck behind it.</p>

                        <p>It’s a little difficult to show a clear before and after for position:absolute, since you can position a block anywhere on a page. We'll start from our usual starting point:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--inline blocks code-->

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--inline blocks-->

                        <p>and make these changes to our CSS:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/APC.png" /> <!--CSS code-->

                        <p>And the result: 4 blocks positioned exactly 200 pixels from the left and top, all stacked one on top of the other.</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/EOAP.png" /> <!--Website with block at 200px from left and right -->

                        <h4>Position: Fixed</h4>

                        <p>The final positioning tool we’re going to look at is position:fixed. Position:fixed has some cool applications. Let’s say you have a website featuring a lot of content in a central feed, and then a menu bar on the left with the tools to navigate around the website, such as links to the various sections of your website. You would ideally like for people to be able to scroll through the central feed of content without losing the menu bar that helps them navigate around the site, but how to do that? Enter position:fixed!</p>

                        <p>Position:fixed tells the browser that no matter how the screen moves, it needs to leave this element at this exact spot, relative to the browser window. It’s kind of like putting a sticky note on your computer screen; no matter what moves around it, you will still see the sticky note and its contents.</p>

                        <p>Here is an example of the code for this inserted into a larger website:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/FPC.png" /> <!--HTML/CSS code-->

                        <p>And the resulting website at the top:

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/EOFP1.png" /> <!-- Website scrolled to top -->

                        <p>and the bottom of the screen:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/EOFP2.png" /> <!-- Website scrolled to top -->

                        <p>As you can see, the main content of the page scrolled down while the sidebar stayed in a fixed position.</p>

                        <p>And that’s about it. I hope you’ve left here with a slightly better understanding of the differences in these three CSS elements.

                	<p>I’m really excited about Dev Bootcamp. I was drawn to the idea that DBC was not just a coding program, but was focused on creating programmers who were better people in addition to better programmers. Shereef’s focus on that made me feel a lot better. My general impression of DBC is an intense program of learning and improving constantly. I think I can dive into that and contribute a lot to that environment; I have some history with social justice work and I like that aspect of the program. I would say that my expectations have somewhat increased; I am even more excited to dive in. I’m a little nervous, but not terrified. I think I can do this, but I know it’s going to be extremely difficult. I’m looking forward to the challenge.</p>

                	<h2>Feedly</h2>

                	<p><a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> is one of my favorite sites because it gives me an easy way to keep track of the content on a few hundred websites and it allows me to easily add new interests and quickly learn about them. No matter what distance you view it from, the eye is drawn to the content. Feedly gives you a lot of ways to view your subscriptions, but every page model is focused on those subscriptions. The eye is always drawn to the content, and that is the most important part of the site. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Feedly are: basic, bright, busy, informative, green. Feedly answers the question: “How do I keep up to date with lots and lots of websites without investing tons of time?”. The main site has no self-generated content. Five adjectives I would use to describe Feedly's content, focus, and purpose are: practical, intense, focused, simple, purposeful. These are very in-line with the visual aspect of the site. On Feedly, it is very easy to find what you are looking for everywhere; after you are logged in, there’s really only one page design and navigation is simple and straightforward. It is extremely easy to browse through all the content on the site. Generally I feel fulfilled after using Feedly. It does exactly what I need it to do. Feedly sells a service upgrapde. I have purchased it, because they do good work and I want to support that.</p>

                	<h2>Tumblr</h2>

               		<p>I like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> because it allows me to follow a more esoteric/picture-heavy information stream and to easily publish my own content if I so desire. The eye is always drawn to the central feed, which is absolutely the most important part of the site. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Tumblr are: bipartite, contrasting, cluttered, content-oriented, blue. Tumblr meets two needs: first, “I want to create a blog that’s primarily a stream of images, but I don’t have technical ability,” and second, “I want to follow the image-curating abilities of a bunch of people who aren’t technically oriented.” Tumblr produces very little of its own content, but a tremendous amount of user-generated content. Five adjectives I would use to describe Tumblr's content, focus, and purpose are: distraction, rambling, pictorial, silly, tempestuous. This is fairly aligned with the visual approach, as you can feel the competing impulses between following and creating. From the homepage, Tumblr is very easy to navigate. From other pages, it can range from easy to incredibly difficult. Similarly, it is very easy to browse through all the content on the homepage, but it ranges between very easy and virtually impossible everywhere else. After using Tumblr, I usually feel entertained, but unfulfilled. Frequently it feels like I’ve wasted time. I do not believe Tumblr sells anything, so no.</p>

                	<h2>Fitocracy</h2>

                	<p>I appreciate <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/">Fitocracy</a> because it lets me track my workouts and has a solid mobile presence for doing so. The most prominent thing you see at close range is the tracked information. From a distance, the most prominent aspect is the logo. This is definitely not the most important thing. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Fitocracy are: bright, simple, confused, separated, purple. Fitocracy is focused on answering the question: “How do I track my fitness and stay inspired to keep working out?” Content-wise, Fitocracy has lots of information about various exercises and articles about working out. Five adjectives I would use to describe Fitocracy's content, focus, and purpose are: disjointed, bipolar, useful, unfocused, disparate. It feels like the visual design and the content/focus/purpose are similarly poorly planned. Depending on what you’re looking for, finding things can be difficult or easy. Some things are evident on most pages, others are difficult to find on most pages. Browsing through the content isn't infuriating, but it isn't simple. When I use Fitocracy, I usually finish happy that I can track my fitness, but irritated at the myriad issues with the site. Fitocracy sells a premium service upgrade, but I have not purchased it, because I don’t see any use for it and don’t feel the developers particularly deserve support.</p>
