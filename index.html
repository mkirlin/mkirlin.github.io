                    <h3>1 June 2014</h3>

                <article>

                    <p>I'm mostly Abstract Seqeuntial. Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random are roughly tied well behind that, and then Abstract Random distantly trails everything.</p>
                    <p>Abstract sequential thinkers analyze and react. They tend to do best when they can see the big picture. They’re typically precise and logical, and they use facts to make their case. They like to read to get information. They tend to be rules-followers. They don’t like being rushed, working with incomplete information, unclear or incomplete instructions, having to express their emotions, or working with people who aren’t as logical or talented as they are.</p>
                    <p>My biggest struggle is just getting everything done. I am a procrastinator and it has hurt me throughout my life. I’m trying to build a system that will let me get work done more efficiently without being distracted as often, but it is difficult. It isn’t really related to my thinking style, except in the abstract; my style of thinking and working lets me elaborately distract myself. My current strategies include:

                        <ul>
                            <li>the use of Habit RPG to organize my days and tasks</li>
                            <li>writing things by hand when possible, rather than always being on the computer</li>
                            <li>using a system similar to the Pomodoro technique to get work done</li>
                            <li>work schedules and pre-programmed distraction breaks</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>I think the main thing that will help me expand and grow my learning style is to focus on the things that both my learning style predicts and that I know from experience that I am not good at. I struggle with having to do work without prep time, making sure every little piece of work is perfect, not competing excessively, and not monopolizing interactions. These are all things that AS thinkers are identified as struggling with. I’m going to keep working on these tendencies, pushing in the direction that my brain isn’t naturally pointed towards. I think that doing so will broaden my abilities and my competencies.</p>

                    <h3>1 June 2014</h3>
                </header>
            
                <article>

                    <h2>Why is it popular?</h2>
                    <p>The primary reasons JavaScript is popular is because it’s easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to customize for whatever uses you need. It is increasingly built into the backbone of the web, making it a necessary tool for dynamic websites. Also, the community has to some degree become self-perpetuating: the popularity of JavaScript means there are more resources available, and more people who can help solve problems with it, and more smart people making more add-ons and extensions.</p>
                    <h2>What are the great things about it?</h2>
                    <p>It’s easy to edit; all you need is a simple text editor and you can write JavaScript. You can learn it quickly and easily. Lots and lots of smart people have built things for it, so it has a lot of good libraries like jQuery that make it easy to use. It utilizes AJAX, which lets it reload parts of the page without having to reload the entire page. It loads quickly, and it loads on the client side, reducing server load. Basically, it’s a highly flexible, highly useful, tool with lots of applications.</p>
                    <h2>What are its limitations?</h2>
                    <p>The primary limitation with JavaScript is that it has some security holes that can be exploited by people with some knowledge and bad intent. Also, different browsers can interpret it differently, which can make it difficult to consistently display objects. Finally, due to lingering fears about those security issues, some users disable JavaScript, meaning that some subset of users might be completely incapable of using sites that use JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>I worked on this project with <a href="http://antoniodangond.github.io/">Antonio Dangond</a>. Together, we created a simple site describing Pair Programming, discussing the advantages of PP, and describing how to pair program.

                    <h3>22 May 2014</h3>
                </header>

                    <h2>The Basics</h2>

                        <p>Every single element on a web page is a block. A standard, default web page is organized as one huge block within which you can create smaller blocks that will be stacked, one on top of the other.</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/website_block_model.png" /> <!--website block model-->

                        <p>However, you can tell these blocks to shrink and move around the page. The simplest way to do this is to give a couple of blocks the display:inline property. The code to do this looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--display:inline code-->

                        <p>and it creates this effect on the page:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--inline blocks-->

                        <p>So that’s ok. We can do a block, or we can do a bunch of blocks, all in a line like words wrapping down in a text box. These standard blocks have the inherent code position:static, which simply means they have the position they normally get from the page. But that doesn’t give us the cool effects and designs that we routinely see on the web. To get those, we have to make some other changes to our code.</p>

                    <h2>The Types of Positioning</h2>

                        <h4>Position: Relative</h4>

                        <p>Relative is a somewhat confusing positioning. When you just read the code, it seems like it is relative to some other element in the page. This, however, is incorrect. An item that has position:relative is in fact relative to <em>itself</em>. This means that the page figures out where that item would normally be if it had position:static, then moves it in whatever direction and distance your instructions tell it to move from that initial spot.</p>

                        <p>So say we had this piece of code:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--HTML and CSS creating a few blocks in a page-->

                        <p>It would create a web site that looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--results of above code-->

                        <p>But let’s say we go into that CSS and add this code to it:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/RPC.png" /> <!--CSS with relative positioning added-->

                        <p>Suddenly, our website looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/EORP.png" /> <!--website with shifted block-->

                        <p>The blocks that we had have moved right and down 200 pixels, relative from where it started. That’s really all there is to relative positioning.</p>

                        <h4>Position: Absolute</h4>

                        <p>Our next piece of code, position: absolute, is a little easier to wrap our minds around. This piece of code puts our block, or whatever element it is applied to, and sticks it to one exact position on the page. You give it the coordinates, and your block goes to that exact spot and stays there. This is powerful, but it has the potential to mess up how your website looks. An item with position:absolute is taken out of the flow of the page, so other items can potentially get stuck behind it.</p>

                        <p>It’s a little difficult to show a clear before and after for position:absolute, since you can position a block anywhere on a page. We'll start from our usual starting point:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--inline blocks code-->

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--inline blocks-->

                        <p>and make these changes to our CSS:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/APC.png" /> <!--CSS code-->

                        <p>And the result: 4 blocks positioned exactly 200 pixels from the left and top, all stacked one on top of the other.</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/EOAP.png" /> <!--Website with block at 200px from left and right -->

                        <h4>Position: Fixed</h4>

                        <p>The final positioning tool we’re going to look at is position:fixed. Position:fixed has some cool applications. Let’s say you have a website featuring a lot of content in a central feed, and then a menu bar on the left with the tools to navigate around the website, such as links to the various sections of your website. You would ideally like for people to be able to scroll through the central feed of content without losing the menu bar that helps them navigate around the site, but how to do that? Enter position:fixed!</p>

                        <p>Position:fixed tells the browser that no matter how the screen moves, it needs to leave this element at this exact spot, relative to the browser window. It’s kind of like putting a sticky note on your computer screen; no matter what moves around it, you will still see the sticky note and its contents.</p>

                        <p>Here is an example of the code for this inserted into a larger website:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/FPC.png" /> <!--HTML/CSS code-->

                        <p>And the resulting website at the top:

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/EOFP1.png" /> <!-- Website scrolled to top -->

                        <p>and the bottom of the screen:</p>

                        <img src="./unit1_projects/images/EOFP2.png" /> <!-- Website scrolled to top -->

                        <p>As you can see, the main content of the page scrolled down while the sidebar stayed in a fixed position.</p>

                        <p>And that’s about it. I hope you’ve left here with a slightly better understanding of the differences in these three CSS elements.

                	<p>I’m really excited about Dev Bootcamp. I was drawn to the idea that DBC was not just a coding program, but was focused on creating programmers who were better people in addition to better programmers. Shereef’s focus on that made me feel a lot better. My general impression of DBC is an intense program of learning and improving constantly. I think I can dive into that and contribute a lot to that environment; I have some history with social justice work and I like that aspect of the program. I would say that my expectations have somewhat increased; I am even more excited to dive in. I’m a little nervous, but not terrified. I think I can do this, but I know it’s going to be extremely difficult. I’m looking forward to the challenge.</p>

                	<h2>Feedly</h2>

                	<p><a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> is one of my favorite sites because it gives me an easy way to keep track of the content on a few hundred websites and it allows me to easily add new interests and quickly learn about them. No matter what distance you view it from, the eye is drawn to the content. Feedly gives you a lot of ways to view your subscriptions, but every page model is focused on those subscriptions. The eye is always drawn to the content, and that is the most important part of the site. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Feedly are: basic, bright, busy, informative, green. Feedly answers the question: “How do I keep up to date with lots and lots of websites without investing tons of time?”. The main site has no self-generated content. Five adjectives I would use to describe Feedly's content, focus, and purpose are: practical, intense, focused, simple, purposeful. These are very in-line with the visual aspect of the site. On Feedly, it is very easy to find what you are looking for everywhere; after you are logged in, there’s really only one page design and navigation is simple and straightforward. It is extremely easy to browse through all the content on the site. Generally I feel fulfilled after using Feedly. It does exactly what I need it to do. Feedly sells a service upgrapde. I have purchased it, because they do good work and I want to support that.</p>

                	<h2>Tumblr</h2>

               		<p>I like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> because it allows me to follow a more esoteric/picture-heavy information stream and to easily publish my own content if I so desire. The eye is always drawn to the central feed, which is absolutely the most important part of the site. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Tumblr are: bipartite, contrasting, cluttered, content-oriented, blue. Tumblr meets two needs: first, “I want to create a blog that’s primarily a stream of images, but I don’t have technical ability,” and second, “I want to follow the image-curating abilities of a bunch of people who aren’t technically oriented.” Tumblr produces very little of its own content, but a tremendous amount of user-generated content. Five adjectives I would use to describe Tumblr's content, focus, and purpose are: distraction, rambling, pictorial, silly, tempestuous. This is fairly aligned with the visual approach, as you can feel the competing impulses between following and creating. From the homepage, Tumblr is very easy to navigate. From other pages, it can range from easy to incredibly difficult. Similarly, it is very easy to browse through all the content on the homepage, but it ranges between very easy and virtually impossible everywhere else. After using Tumblr, I usually feel entertained, but unfulfilled. Frequently it feels like I’ve wasted time. I do not believe Tumblr sells anything, so no.</p>

                	<h2>Fitocracy</h2>

                	<p>I appreciate <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/">Fitocracy</a> because it lets me track my workouts and has a solid mobile presence for doing so. The most prominent thing you see at close range is the tracked information. From a distance, the most prominent aspect is the logo. This is definitely not the most important thing. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Fitocracy are: bright, simple, confused, separated, purple. Fitocracy is focused on answering the question: “How do I track my fitness and stay inspired to keep working out?” Content-wise, Fitocracy has lots of information about various exercises and articles about working out. Five adjectives I would use to describe Fitocracy's content, focus, and purpose are: disjointed, bipolar, useful, unfocused, disparate. It feels like the visual design and the content/focus/purpose are similarly poorly planned. Depending on what you’re looking for, finding things can be difficult or easy. Some things are evident on most pages, others are difficult to find on most pages. Browsing through the content isn't infuriating, but it isn't simple. When I use Fitocracy, I usually finish happy that I can track my fitness, but irritated at the myriad issues with the site. Fitocracy sells a premium service upgrade, but I have not purchased it, because I don’t see any use for it and don’t feel the developers particularly deserve support.</p>
