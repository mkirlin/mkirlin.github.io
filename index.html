            	<article>

                	<p>I’m really excited about Dev Bootcamp. I was drawn to the idea that DBC was not just a coding program, but was focused on creating programmers who were better people in addition to better programmers. Shereef’s focus on that made me feel a lot better. My general impression of DBC is an intense program of learning and improving constantly. I think I can dive into that and contribute a lot to that environment; I have some history with social justice work and I like that aspect of the program. I would say that my expectations have somewhat increased; I am even more excited to dive in. I’m a little nervous, but not terrified. I think I can do this, but I know it’s going to be extremely difficult. I’m looking forward to the challenge.</p>

                	<h2>Feedly</h2>

                	<p><a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> is one of my favorite sites because it gives me an easy way to keep track of the content on a few hundred websites and it allows me to easily add new interests and quickly learn about them. No matter what distance you view it from, the eye is drawn to the content. Feedly gives you a lot of ways to view your subscriptions, but every page model is focused on those subscriptions. The eye is always drawn to the content, and that is the most important part of the site. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Feedly are: basic, bright, busy, informative, green. Feedly answers the question: “How do I keep up to date with lots and lots of websites without investing tons of time?”. The main site has no self-generated content. Five adjectives I would use to describe Feedly's content, focus, and purpose are: practical, intense, focused, simple, purposeful. These are very in-line with the visual aspect of the site. On Feedly, it is very easy to find what you are looking for everywhere; after you are logged in, there’s really only one page design and navigation is simple and straightforward. It is extremely easy to browse through all the content on the site. Generally I feel fulfilled after using Feedly. It does exactly what I need it to do. Feedly sells a service upgrapde. I have purchased it, because they do good work and I want to support that.</p>

                	<h2>Tumblr</h2>

               		<p>I like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> because it allows me to follow a more esoteric/picture-heavy information stream and to easily publish my own content if I so desire. The eye is always drawn to the central feed, which is absolutely the most important part of the site. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Tumblr are: bipartite, contrasting, cluttered, content-oriented, blue. Tumblr meets two needs: first, “I want to create a blog that’s primarily a stream of images, but I don’t have technical ability,” and second, “I want to follow the image-curating abilities of a bunch of people who aren’t technically oriented.” Tumblr produces very little of its own content, but a tremendous amount of user-generated content. Five adjectives I would use to describe Tumblr's content, focus, and purpose are: distraction, rambling, pictorial, silly, tempestuous. This is fairly aligned with the visual approach, as you can feel the competing impulses between following and creating. From the homepage, Tumblr is very easy to navigate. From other pages, it can range from easy to incredibly difficult. Similarly, it is very easy to browse through all the content on the homepage, but it ranges between very easy and virtually impossible everywhere else. After using Tumblr, I usually feel entertained, but unfulfilled. Frequently it feels like I’ve wasted time. I do not believe Tumblr sells anything, so no.</p>

                	<h2>Fitocracy</h2>

                	<p>I appreciate <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/">Fitocracy</a> because it lets me track my workouts and has a solid mobile presence for doing so. The most prominent thing you see at close range is the tracked information. From a distance, the most prominent aspect is the logo. This is definitely not the most important thing. Five adjectives I would use to visually describe Fitocracy are: bright, simple, confused, separated, purple. Fitocracy is focused on answering the question: “How do I track my fitness and stay inspired to keep working out?” Content-wise, Fitocracy has lots of information about various exercises and articles about working out. Five adjectives I would use to describe Fitocracy's content, focus, and purpose are: disjointed, bipolar, useful, unfocused, disparate. It feels like the visual design and the content/focus/purpose are similarly poorly planned. Depending on what you’re looking for, finding things can be difficult or easy. Some things are evident on most pages, others are difficult to find on most pages. Browsing through the content isn't infuriating, but it isn't simple. When I use Fitocracy, I usually finish happy that I can track my fitness, but irritated at the myriad issues with the site. Fitocracy sells a premium service upgrade, but I have not purchased it, because I don’t see any use for it and don’t feel the developers particularly deserve support.</p>

                	<a href="http://imgur.com/qe8RbVv"><img src="http://imgur.com/qe8RbVv.png" /></a>

                	<p><a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> answers the question: “How do I keep up to date with lots and lots of websites without investing tons of time?”. The primary visual challenge it experiences is that it has to display lots and lots of info from lots and lots of sources in a manner that is visualy coherent without being overwhelming.</p>

                	<h2>Tumblr</h2>

                	<a href="http://imgur.com/2sD7Ikx"><img src="http://imgur.com/2sD7Ikx.png" /></a>

                	<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> meets two needs: first, “I want to create a blog that’s primarily a stream of images, but I don’t have technical ability,” and second, “I want to follow the image-curating abilities of a bunch of people who aren’t technically oriented.” The primary visual challenges it experiences are displaying all the content a user wants, anticipating what else they might want to see, and giving them the ability to generate their own content without distracting from the content they want to see.</p>

                	<a href="http://imgur.com/q2AawFZ"><img src="http://imgur.com/q2AawFZ.png" /></a>

                	<p><a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/">Fitocracy</a> is focused on answering the question: “How do I track my fitness and stay inspired to keep working out?” The primary visual challenge it experiences is how to integrate tracking of the workout information with the community and motivation aspects (images, connections between people).</p>
