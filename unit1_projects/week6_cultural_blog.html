                	<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

                    <p>As a white man, I don't think that I have experienced stereotype threat myself, except in a joking fashion. Generally, our society functions in a mode of white male supremacy, which means that even stereotypes about those two identifiers tend towards being gentle. However, I have known people who experienced stereotype threat - a cousin who constantly worries that she's being judged for being black, and who focuses on appearing nonthreatening when she goes out jogging, a friend in undergrad who avoided walking around at night because he was worried about being hassled by the police. I find this heartbreaking, but their precautions are understandable given this nation's history of racism and especially the last few years of violence committed against young black men and women.<p>

                    <p>I doubt that I'm join to feel stereotype threat any time soon. I don't know that there's any good way to respond if someone feeling it; I think it's more important to help create an environment where the danger of stereotype threat is minimized as much as possible. That means creating an environment where racism is called out, where the people in our group actively work to combat bigotry. It means education about the achievements of minority groups and active work to dispel negative stereotypes that contribute to stereotype threat. I think that I can contribute by supporting these efforts when I can and by stepping aside and letting minority leaders take point on these issues while I support them. I think there's a danger when members of the majority take on positions that support minority concerns that the voices of the majority supporters can overwhelm minorities who are directly affected by issues like stereotype threat.</p>
