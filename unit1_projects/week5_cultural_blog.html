                	<p>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</p>

                    <p>It's been kind of challenging. Parts of it have been a lot of fun; I had a session last week that was really rewarding, and at the end of it I really felt like I had learned a lot. However, there have also been pairings where I've felt superflouous, pairings where I've felt frustrated because I've outstripped the other person, and pairings where we just didn't click. Overall, I think I'm liking it slightly more than I'm disliking it, but it is definitely raising conflicting feelings in me.</p>

                    <p>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</p>

                    <p>The pair chellange last week - challenge 6, debugging the North Korean missile code - was a ton of fun. At the end of it, I felt like I had a really firm grasp of a lot of the subjects we were working on and I had a great time working with my pair.</p>

                    <p>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</p>

                    <p>I have had two pairing sessions where I felt like we weren't really on the same page, and the pairing suffered from that. I also think there's a side of my personality that has very little patience or sympathy for people who don't get things quickly, and I have had a pairing session or two where I was short with my partner because I was feeling somewhat contemptuous of the other person. That's a problem with my attitude, though.</p>

                    <p>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</p>

                    <p>Mostly pretty good, with a side helping of unhappiness. There were a few pieces of feedback that were positive with qualifications, and I tend to read that as criticism. But I also recognize that I have a tendency towards being overbearing - it's a familial trait - and that came through in some of the feedback.</p>

                    <p>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</p>

                    <p>It was. I know some of the things I need to work on; I've spent a long time reprogramming my own social interactions, but I know I have a lot of ground left to cover. It's always good to get feedback on those things. I feel like you'll never improve if you don't get good feedback, and I need that interaction.</p>

                    <p>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</p>

                    <p>I am constantly trying to relinquish the lead, and not be too "RAH RAH LEADERSHIP." That's the hardest thing for me, and I'm going to keep working on not dominating interactions.</p>

                    <p>How was it to write feedback?</p>

                    <p>Surprisingly difficult. I tried to keep ASK in mind when I was writing feedback and it was difficult. Being anything other than critical was difficult. I am conditioned to give feedback in a different way, and it has proved difficult to give good feedback in DBC.</p>

                    <p>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</p>

                    <p>It has been different aspects of it. Sometimes, I don't have anything I can think of that's actionable, other times it's tough to be specific. Sometimes you just want to say "Be better!", but that really isn't an option, and I know that, but the lizard brain doesn't really know that.</p>
