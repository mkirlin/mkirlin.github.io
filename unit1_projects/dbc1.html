			What This Is:
		</h2>
		<p>
			Hi, and welcome to my homepage. I'm creating this page for a project in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, a nine-week long programming bootcamp wherein a small group of students learn the basics of professional web development. My session starts on July 14, 2014, and I could not be more excited to start this next phase of my life. <br> <br>This website will be formatted in what could be considered a slightly wonky fashion (this is top-secret code for "ugly"), as I have certain requirements I need to fulfill, but I hope to eventually build it out into a full-featured homepage for myself. If you (for some odd reason) see this page and suddenly feel the desperate, burning need to contact me, <a href="mailto:mkirlin@gmail.com">shoot me an email.</a>

			About Me:
		</h2>

		<p>
			Information! You can probably guess the topic fairly easily.
		</p>
		
		<h3 class="title">
			Where I'm Coming From:
		</h3>

		<p>
			I am originally from West Des Moines, IA, a suburb of Des Moines, IA. I went to grade school and high school there, and then I attended <a href="https://www.creighton.edu/" target="_blank">Creighton University</a> in Omaha, NE for my undergrad and various post-graduate activities.
		</p>

		<h6 class="title">
			(I promise that isn't pointlessly vague. I'm building to it.)
		</h6>

		<h3 class="title">
			What I Did, For A While:
		</h3>

		<p>
			In undergrad I majored in Spanish and International Relations. I'm mostly fluent in the former, and somewhat fluent in the latter. The plan after that was law school, also at Creighton. This turned out to be a terrible plan.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a semester of law school, I realized law wasn't for me. So I left law school. I decided to get an MA in education, a path I had contemplated before settling on the safer choice of law school.
		</p>
		<h6 class="title">
			(If you're at all familiar with the legal job market at the moment, you're probably laughing already. Go ahead and get it out, I'll wait.)
		</h6>
		<p>
			I finished my MA, but I realized that I wasn't content with teaching. I had the opportunity to work in a classroom equipped with iPads, and I realized a few things while I worked there.
		</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Technology, utilized effectively, can dramatically improve the classroom experience, <strong>BUT</strong></li>
				<li>Technology, as it exists today, is near-useless in the average classroom</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			What I wanted to do was build the tools that teachers and parents could use to actually use technology in a way that complemented and enhanced the classroom experience the way that I know it can. I looked around for what skills I would need to build those tools, and I found Dev Bootcamp.
		</p>

		<h6 class="title">
			(Whoa. Ok, so that was kind of heavy.)
