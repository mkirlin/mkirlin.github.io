                	<a href="http://imgur.com/qe8RbVv"><img src="http://imgur.com/qe8RbVv.png" /></a>

                	<p><a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> answers the question: “How do I keep up to date with lots and lots of websites without investing tons of time?”. The primary visual challenge it experiences is that it has to display lots and lots of info from lots and lots of sources in a manner that is visualy coherent without being overwhelming.</p>

                	<h2>Tumblr</h2>

                	<a href="http://imgur.com/2sD7Ikx"><img src="http://imgur.com/2sD7Ikx.png" /></a>

                	<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> meets two needs: first, “I want to create a blog that’s primarily a stream of images, but I don’t have technical ability,” and second, “I want to follow the image-curating abilities of a bunch of people who aren’t technically oriented.” The primary visual challenges it experiences are displaying all the content a user wants, anticipating what else they might want to see, and giving them the ability to generate their own content without distracting from the content they want to see.</p>

                	<h2>Fitocracy</h2>

                	<a href="http://imgur.com/q2AawFZ"><img src="http://imgur.com/q2AawFZ.png" /></a>

                	<p><a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/">Fitocracy</a> is focused on answering the question: “How do I track my fitness and stay inspired to keep working out?” The primary visual challenge it experiences is how to integrate tracking of the workout information with the community and motivation aspects (images, connections between people).</p>
