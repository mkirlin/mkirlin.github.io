                	<h1>Explaining JavaScript's Popularity in Web Development</h1>

                	<h2>Why is it popular?</h2>
                    <p>The primary reasons JavaScript is popular is because it’s easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to customize for whatever uses you need. It is increasingly built into the backbone of the web, making it a necessary tool for dynamic websites. Also, the community has to some degree become self-perpetuating: the popularity of JavaScript means there are more resources available, and more people who can help solve problems with it, and more smart people making more add-ons and extensions.</p>
                    <h2>What are the great things about it?</h2>
                    <p>It’s easy to edit; all you need is a simple text editor and you can write JavaScript. You can learn it quickly and easily. Lots and lots of smart people have built things for it, so it has a lot of good libraries like jQuery that make it easy to use. It utilizes AJAX, which lets it reload parts of the page without having to reload the entire page. It loads quickly, and it loads on the client side, reducing server load. Basically, it’s a highly flexible, highly useful, tool with lots of applications.</p>
                    <h2>What are its limitations?</h2>
                    <p>The primary limitation with JavaScript is that it has some security holes that can be exploited by people with some knowledge and bad intent. Also, different browsers can interpret it differently, which can make it difficult to consistently display objects. Finally, due to lingering fears about those security issues, some users disable JavaScript, meaning that some subset of users might be completely incapable of using sites that use JavaScript.</p>
