                	<p>I’m really excited about Dev Bootcamp. I was drawn to the idea that DBC was not just a coding program, but was focused on creating programmers who were better people in addition to better programmers. Shereef’s focus on that made me feel a lot better. My general impression of DBC is an intense program of learning and improving constantly. I think I can dive into that and contribute a lot to that environment; I have some history with social justice work and I like that aspect of the program. I would say that my expectations have somewhat increased; I am even more excited to dive in. I’m a little nervous, but not terrified. I think I can do this, but I know it’s going to be extremely difficult. I’m looking forward to the challenge.</p>
