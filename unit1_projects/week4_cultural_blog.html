                	<h2>Privacy in Technology</h2>

                    <p>The biggest problem that is currently facing the tech industry is that people have lost confidence in the ability or willingness of tech companies to protect their privacy.</p> 

                    <h2>Background</h2>

                    <p>A series of revelations over the course of the last year that began with Edward Snowden’s leaking of confidential NSA documents have shown that the government has routinely spied on American citizens and they have done so with the cooperation of the major technology companies. In some cases, the relationships between the ever-expanding surveillance state and the massive players in Silicon Valley goes back almost two decades. In some cases, companies like Microsoft “collaborated closely with U.S. intelligence services to allow users’ communications to be intercepted, including helping the National Security Agency to circumvent the company’s own encryption.” Essentially, a number of major technology companies gave the government a massive backdoor into their products and user bases, right at a time when those user bases were growing massively and more and more people were sharing more and more information. Suddenly the government had its hands on a tremendous trove of information and, concerningly, there was no oversight into what this information was being used for.</p>

                    <p>Now, it would be an overstatement to say that this was a complete surprise. People who were paying close attention to the growth of the surveillance state over the last several years had some understanding that something like this was probably going on, but the Snowden release acted to confirm every single nightmare that many people had about the interactions between the major firms in Silicon Valley and the U.S. government. The government had been engaged in a massive effort to spy on the United States citizenry and the luminaries of Silicon Valley had happily aided in this effort.</p>

                    <h2>Why is this a problem?</h2>

                    <p>This question is a legitimate one to ask. After all, despite the massively illegal nature of the government’s actions in the last decade as revealed by Edward Snowden, most Americans think that some degree of surveillance is a necessity. Some large percentage of Americans have accepted the default, necessary, but tragic view that it is inevitable that the government is going to spy on its people. However, the technology industry does not need to be the facilitators of this spying, and I believe that, by allowing the government to so thoroughly enmesh the surveillance state into the technology industry, the industry is risking that it will come to be seen as fruit of the poisoned tree, so to speak. If technology cannot be trusted, then there is no point in buying it. On some level, people are willing to buy things as long as there are some protections involved; they will store their data on the cloud if they don’t think it will be stolen, or they will allow their communications to be transmitted if they don’t think that every message will be intercepted by the government. If the tech industry loses that trust, it will be gone for good, and I suspect that much of the current boom in prosperity will go with it.</p>

                    <h2>How can this problem be solved?</h2>

                    <p>Well, the cynical, but unfortunately probably accurate view is that it can’t be solved. The US government is a massively powerful entity and it can make life very, very difficult for companies that don’t work with it. If even companies like Google and Apple can be cowed by the government, then any company probably can be. If more companies were to follow the lead of LavaBit, an email provider used by Edward Snowden who destroyed his archives rather than give the government access to them, there might be some hope for solving this problem, but the evidence as it stands suggests that none of the major tech players are or ever were willing to actually fight for their users’ privacy. Increasingly it seems that the only real solution will be for companies to attempt to spin the erosion of privacy and for users to dial down there expectations for what level of privacy they will enjoy on the internet. </p>
