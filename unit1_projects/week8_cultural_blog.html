                	<h2>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h2>

                    <p>On my recent trip to Hong Kong, I roomed with my brother, Matt. He is 20 years old, and I love him dearly, but he can be very difficult to be around. We're both intensely stubborn, argumentative people, and this is frequently compounded by his ADHD, which makes it difficult for him to remember things and structure his time efficiently. The trip was short, and during the 5 days we spent in China, we had to take a trip from Hong Kong to Zhuhai for an evening and then go back the next day. This necessitated a lot of packing and organization, as traveling between Hong Kong and mainland China requires passage through immigration. I had a meeting with some of my cousins earlier in the evening to go over a presentation we were giving the next day. Before I met with them, I talked to Matt and reminded him to pack up and get his passport and documents ready, as we had a 6 AM wake-up call. The meeting wrapped up around 12 AM and I returned to our room to find him asleep, his things scattered around the room, and his passport somewhere in the mess. I was upset; I woke him up and demanded that he locate his passport, pack up his things, and generally prepare. He got angry in response to my anger, and we had a brief, but intense argument. I took a walk to calm down and when I got back we packed up and got to bed in time to get about 4.5 hours of sleep.</p>

                    <h2>What was the source of the conflict?</h2>

                    <p>Matt not packing his bags or locating his travel documents and my inability to control my irritation at that.</p>

                    <h2>How did you handle that conflict?</h2>

                    <p>My first reaction, as described above, was to get angry and fight with him about it. My second action was to take a walk, cool down, and then come back to work with him to solve the problem.</p>

                    <h2>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h2>

                    <p>My first action made it worse. My second action made it better.</p>

                    <h2>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h2>

                    <p>I would have changed my behavior before and after the conflict. I should have worked with Matt to build a checklist for what he needed to do; he works better with explicit instructions and physical mementos. I also would change how I behaved when I returned to the room and woke him up. I wouldn't go into the first interaction angry; I would take the walk first to cool down, then come back, calmly wake him up, and finish the work we needed to do.</p>

                    <h2>What did you learn from this experience?</h2>

                    <p>To be honest, I can't say that I learned much from the experience. My brother and I have struggled with anger management for a very long time. We inherited the issues from our father, who also shares Matt's ADHD, and all three of us have gone through various types of treatment to ameliorate our struggles with angry outbursts. The "what would you change" section was easy to write for me, because I've been doing exercises like this since I was 8 and I know exactly what I should have done that would have been a better response. For me, the issue isn't that I need to learn the right ways to act, it's that I need to consistently implement them.</p>

                    <p>I have improved dramatically over the years, but it's still a constant process. In some ways, it's like recovering from an addiction; you're never completely free of it. The therapist that I worked with when I was in my teens was an admirer, with qualifications, of the 12 step process and a lot of that bled over into how I deal with issues like this: you have to constantly take your inventory, recovery is a process, not an event, so on and so forth. One of my favorite parts of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> was where Tan talks about recognizing the physical signs of an oncoming emotion, because that's something that I've been working on now for a decade and a half. Recognizing that you're getting angry is one of the best ways to defuse it. What the incident with my brother reinforced was that I'm still not where I want to be, but the fact that we were able to defuse the situation, where even just a few years earlier it might have turned into a huge explosive fight, means that we're both progressing, and that makes me happy.</p>
