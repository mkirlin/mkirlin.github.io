                    <p><strong>Exploring your values - When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</strong></p>

                    <p>Competence, confidence, efficiency, decisiveness, independence, accomplishment, freedom, intellectual</p>

                    <p><strong>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</strong></p>

                    <p>Confidence is incredibly important to me because I believe that to some degree everything else flows from confidence. If you are not confident, it is difficult to do everything. If you believe that you can do something, or even if you're just capable of projecting the appearance of believing in yourself, you can achieve amazing things. I have noticed a consistent pattern in my life and the lives of others that when people are relatively equal in ability, but one is more confident than the other, they tend to be more successful.</p> 

                    <p>I first started noticing this is one skill in my own life: speaking another language. When I carefully think through what I'm saying, translate every word with caution, insist on conjugating every verb perfectly, and generally overthink the process, I couldn't speak the language. But when I am able to set that overly-perfectionist mind aside and just talk, trusting in my abilities, I could carry on conversations with native speakers, and even if I made errors, they just didn't matter that much. When I began to pay attention to it, I started to realize that the effect carried through elsewhere in life: if you approach a situation with confidence in yourself, the experience will go more smoothly. It is especially effective in interpersonal relationships. If you are able to project confidence, even if you're just faking it convincingly, other people will be drawn to you. Confidence is the fountain from which everything else flows, and so it is the most important.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:

                    In general, I try to live up to these values:

                    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</strong></p>

                    <p>I would say 4. I do try. I fail, like anyone, but I still strive to live up to them.</p>

                    <p><strong>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</strong></p>

                    <p>Well, my girlfriend asked me if I thought she had too many pairs of sweatpants, but I have a feeling that wasn't exactly what was being asked. The last serious topic that I was consulted on was whether or not a friend of mine should give up a dream of going to medical school after 3 years of not being accepted.</p>

                    <p><strong>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</strong></p>

                    <p>Happy, sometimes either proud of disappointed in myself depending on how well I'm living up to them at any given time. I said in my post about stereotype threat that I don't think I'm ever going to experience much of it, but yes, I think knowing your values and guiding principles could help alleviate the pressures you might feel from stereotypes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</strong></p>

                    <p>Well, the primary thing that I am going to need to do to avoid/fix feeling down is literally exercise. I'm of the Henry Rollins school - working out is the best way for me to feel better. If I'm out of the gym for too long, I don't do well. Other than that, I mostly think it's going to be about periodically finding time to be alone and recharge.</p>
