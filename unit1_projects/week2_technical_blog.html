                    <h2>The Basics</h2>

                        <p>Every single element on a web page is a block. A standard, default web page is organized as one huge block within which you can create smaller blocks that will be stacked, one on top of the other.</p>

                        <img src="./images/website_block_model.png" /> <!--website block model-->

                        <p>However, you can tell these blocks to shrink and move around the page. The simplest way to do this is to give a couple of blocks the display:inline property. The code to do this looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--display:inline code-->

                        <p>and it creates this effect on the page:</p>

                        <img src="./images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--inline blocks-->

                        <p>So that’s ok. We can do a block, or we can do a bunch of blocks, all in a line like words wrapping down in a text box. These standard blocks have the inherent code position:static, which simply means they have the position they normally get from the page. But that doesn’t give us the cool effects and designs that we routinely see on the web. To get those, we have to make some other changes to our code.</p>

                    <h2>The Types of Positioning</h2>

                        <h4>Position: Relative</h4>

                        <p>Relative is a somewhat confusing positioning. When you just read the code, it seems like it is relative to some other element in the page. This, however, is incorrect. An item that has position:relative is in fact relative to <em>itself</em>. This means that the page figures out where that item would normally be if it had position:static, then moves it in whatever direction and distance your instructions tell it to move from that initial spot.</p>

                        <p>So say we had this piece of code:</p>

                        <img src="./images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--HTML and CSS creating a few blocks in a page-->

                        <p>It would create a web site that looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--results of above code-->

                        <p>But let’s say we go into that CSS and add this code to it:</p>

                        <img src="./images/RPC.png" /> <!--CSS with relative positioning added-->

                        <p>Suddenly, our website looks like this:</p>

                        <img src="./images/EORP.png" /> <!--website with shifted block-->

                        <p>The blocks that we had have moved right and down 200 pixels, relative from where it started. That’s really all there is to relative positioning.</p>

                        <h4>Position: Absolute</h4>

                        <p>Our next piece of code, position: absolute, is a little easier to wrap our minds around. This piece of code puts our block, or whatever element it is applied to, and sticks it to one exact position on the page. You give it the coordinates, and your block goes to that exact spot and stays there. This is powerful, but it has the potential to mess up how your website looks. An item with position:absolute is taken out of the flow of the page, so other items can potentially get stuck behind it.</p>

                        <p>It’s a little difficult to show a clear before and after for position:absolute, since you can position a block anywhere on a page. We'll start from our usual starting point:</p>

                        <img src="./images/inline_blocks_code.png" /> <!--inline blocks code-->

                        <img src="./images/Inline_blocks.png" /> <!--inline blocks-->

                        <p>and make these changes to our CSS:</p>

                        <img src="./images/APC.png" /> <!--CSS code-->

                        <p>And the result: 4 blocks positioned exactly 200 pixels from the left and top, all stacked one on top of the other.</p>

                        <img src="./images/EOAP.png" /> <!--Website with block at 200px from left and right -->

                        <h4>Position: Fixed</h4>

                        <p>The final positioning tool we’re going to look at is position:fixed. Position:fixed has some cool applications. Let’s say you have a website featuring a lot of content in a central feed, and then a menu bar on the left with the tools to navigate around the website, such as links to the various sections of your website. You would ideally like for people to be able to scroll through the central feed of content without losing the menu bar that helps them navigate around the site, but how to do that? Enter position:fixed!</p>

                        <p>Position:fixed tells the browser that no matter how the screen moves, it needs to leave this element at this exact spot, relative to the browser window. It’s kind of like putting a sticky note on your computer screen; no matter what moves around it, you will still see the sticky note and its contents.</p>

                        <p>Here is an example of the code for this inserted into a larger website:</p>

                        <img src="./images/FPC.png" /> <!--HTML/CSS code-->

                        <p>And the resulting website at the top:

                        <img src="./images/EOFP1.png" /> <!-- Website scrolled to top -->

                        <p>and the bottom of the screen:</p>

                        <img src="./images/EOFP2.png" /> <!-- Website scrolled to top -->

                        <p>As you can see, the main content of the page scrolled down while the sidebar stayed in a fixed position.</p>

                        <p>And that’s about it. I hope you’ve left here with a slightly better understanding of the differences in these three CSS elements.
