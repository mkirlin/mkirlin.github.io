  <h4>Our Project</h4>
  <p>DonationDivvy presents a curated list of local charitable institutions in a single page web app that allows the user to select the amount of money they can donate, pick the charities they'd like to donate to from a list organized by category, choose how that money will be divided among those charities, and then donate immediately. We're in the final stages of tweaking the site and talking to charities in the Chicago area.</p>

  <h4>Technology Used:</h4>
  <p>PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL</p>

  <h4>My Contributions:</h4>
  <p>I helped design and create the page. I used CSS and Bootstrap to style the site and make it mobile-friendly and JavaScript and jQuery to create an interactive, engaging user experience that minimizes friction for the user and will increase donation rates.</p>

  <h4>Our Project</h4>
  <p>Our team created an application for our final project that combined a Google News scraper written by our team, the Alchemy API, used for natural language processing, and code written by our team that compared scraped news articles based on their keywords and sentiment and displayed the maximally dissimilar articles as pairs, giving our users multiple perspectives on the major issues of the day. On our frontend, we used a combination of React and D3.js to display our application and visualize our users' data.</p>

  <h4>Technology Used:</h4>
  <p>Ruby on Rails, RSpec, JavaScript, jQuery, React, D3.js, Capybara, Jasmine, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Heroku</p>

  <h4>My Contributions:</h4>
  <p>I wrote large portions of our frontend. This required me to utilize my knowledge of JavaScript, AJAX, and jQuery, as well as learning React, which we wrote most of the frontend in, and D3.js, which we used to visualize our user data. I also assisted in managing the team by organizing meetings, implementing our Agile procedures, and mediating issues within the team.</p>

  <h4>Our Project</h4>
  <p>We created a web app designed to help users achieve their goals. Our app let users input goals, track their progress towards those goals, and view lists of goals they had achieved. Our goal was to create an app with an excellent UI/UX that inspired users to build their intrinsic motivation, rather than providing the fleeting pleasure of extrinsic motivations like badges or points.</p>

  <h4>Technology Used:</h4>
  <p>Ruby on Rails, RSpec, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Heroku</p>

  <h4>My Contributions:</h4>
  <p>I wrote most of the backend for this app using Ruby on Rails and RSpec for testing and assisted my team members in writing the frontend, using JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. I acted as team lead, implementing our team standups and organization and taking the lead in presenting it to our cohort.</p>
